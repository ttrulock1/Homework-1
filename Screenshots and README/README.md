I worked on this for 8 hours with Chris Champness and David Dyer, then I screwed up all the code, had to start over, then finished it, so this is my code (albeilt any comments I originallly had in the CSS and HTML). I am currently evacuating from New Orleans and Hurricane Ida, so I don't know if I will have time to add these comments again.

I wasn't sure if I needed to keep the other files, so you could see how well the website works. If this is not needed then I will not include it next time. Thank you, and I hope you have nice day. 
I am going to upload three screenshots of the website now as a reference as suggested in my class. I hope you have a nice day.
